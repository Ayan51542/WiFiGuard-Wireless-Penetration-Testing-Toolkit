# Abstract
WiFiGuard enables users to perform attacks such as deauthentication, MAC address spoofing, rogue access point creation, captive portal phishing, and WPA/WPA2 password cracking. The toolkit integrates well-known utilities like aircrack-ng, hostapd, and dnsmasq into a single, cohesive interface for educational and security analysis purposes.

# Core Features
Network Scanning: Detect and gather information on nearby wireless networks and connected clients.
MAC Address Spoofing: Change your wireless card's MAC address to evade basic filters or for anonymity.
Deauthentication Attacks: Disconnect any client from a network to capture WPA/WPA2 handshakes.
WPA/WPA2 Handshake Capture: Automatically capture the 4-way handshake required for password cracking.
Password Cracking: Use aircrack-ng with custom wordlists generated by crunch to crack captured handshakes.
Rogue Access Point: Create a fake AP to lure users into connecting.
Captive Portal Phishing: Launch a fake login page to capture credentials from users connected to the rogue AP.
Automated Tool Installer: A script to install all required dependencies and tools.
Menu-Driven Interface: A simple and intuitive CLI to launch and manage all attacks.

# Tools & Technologies
WiFiGuard orchestrates a suite of powerful, standard-issue wireless security tools.
  Core Utilities:
  aircrack-ng suite: (airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, aircrack-ng) for scanning, packet injection, and password cracking.
  hostapd: For creating access points.
  dnsmasq: For DHCP and DNS services on the rogue AP.
  macchanger: For spoofing MAC addresses.
  crunch: For generating custom wordlists.
  xterm: To run processes in separate terminal windows.
  Flask: To serve the captive portal's phishing page.

Integrated Tools:
The toolkit also includes installers for other popular tools:
  wifite2
  bettercap
  reaver & pixiewps
  ghost-phisher

# Project Structure
The project is organized into modular Python scripts, each handling a specific task:
eth.py: The main entry point. Provides the user-facing menu to access all functionalities.
tools_installer.py: Handles the installation of all prerequisite tools and packages.
enable_monitor_mode.py / disable_monitor_mode.py: Toggles monitor mode on the selected wireless interface.
change_mac_user_input.py: Spoofs the MAC address of the interface.
wifi_scanner.py: Runs airodump-ng to scan for networks.
wifi_attack.py: Launches a deauthentication attack and captures the handshake.
rogue_ap.py: Sets up and configures the rogue access point using hostapd and dnsmasq.
captive_portal.py: Runs a Flask web server to serve the login.html page.
wifi_password_cracker.py: Manages the password cracking process with aircrack-ng.

# Installation & Setup
Prerequisites:
A Linux-based OS (Kali Linux, Parrot OS, or similar is recommended).
A wireless adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection.
Python 3.x.

Steps:
Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-link>

cd WiFiGuard

Make scripts executable:

chmod +x *.py

Run the tool installer:

Execute the installer script to download and configure all dependencies.

sudo python3 tools_installer.py

USAGE
To start the toolkit, run the main script with root privileges:
sudo python3 eth.py
You will be presented with a menu. Select the desired wireless interface and then choose an option to begin an attack or perform a task. The script will guide you through each step, from enabling monitor mode to cracking a password.
